## 🔧 Core Features Explained

### **1. Real-Time Inventory Tracking**

**Problem Solved:** Eliminates manual stock counting and reduces errors

**How It Works:**

```python
# Stock level updates are immediately reflected across the system
inventory.quantity = new_quantity
inventory.last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
# Triggers automatic low stock alerts if below minimum level
```

**Benefits:**

- Instant visibility into stock levels
- Automatic calculation of stock status
- Real-time updates across all user sessions
- Elimination of data entry errors

### **2. Automated Low Stock Alerts**

**Problem Solved:** Prevents stockouts and lost sales

**Alert Logic:**

```python
# System automatically identifies items below minimum levels
if current_stock <= minimum_stock_level:
    trigger_low_stock_alert()
    calculate_priority_level()  # Critical, High, Medium
```

**Alert Features:**

- Color-coded priority levels (Critical: Red, High: Orange, Medium: Yellow)
- Automatic calculation of shortage amounts
- Branch-specific filtering for managers/staff
- Integration with dashboard for immediate visibility

### **3. Transfer Workflow System**

**Problem Solved:** Streamlines inter-branch stock movement

**Workflow Process:**

```
1. Staff/Manager submits transfer request
   ├── System validates stock availability
   └── Checks user permissions

2. Approval Process
   ├── Manager/Owner reviews request
   ├── System shows current stock levels
   └── Approval or rejection with comments

3. Execution
   ├── Automatic stock level adjustments
   ├── Audit trail creation
   └── Notification to relevant parties
```

**Business Benefits:**

- Eliminates manual paperwork
- Ensures proper authorization
- Maintains complete audit trail
- Prevents unauthorized transfers

### **4. Visual Analytics Dashboard**

**Problem Solved:** Transforms raw data into actionable insights

**Chart Types & Purposes:**

```javascript
// Stock Levels by Branch (Bar Chart)
// - Compare inventory levels across locations
// - Identify branches needing attention

// Low Stock by Category (Doughnut Chart)
// - Prioritize purchasing decisions
// - Understand category-wise stock health

// Transfer Activity (Line Chart)
